-datainput : line 5 : global variable that is constantly rewriten for use in switches

-opcre :line 6: global variable designed to be rewrited and used in switches locally ( bad idea)

-opcarray: line 52 : int type var used for switch of arrayfunc (menu for array exercises)

- i,e :line 290-291: int type vars, they are counters in structeje1, local vars,

-count :line : used locally in structeje1 funtion to store how many products are desired by user

Functions: 

-cleanbuff : line 42 : void type function used for clearing in and out buffers

arrayfunc : line 48 : int type function that handles the array excers

-readterfunc_EXER1:line 120 : struct type function (info2), used for recieving and storing user input on "structure info2 input", 
requires an int type var called z ,returns "structure info2 input"

-printerfunc_exer1: line 169: struct info2 type function, requires an info2 type structre, grabs the given struct and prints it if 
the values stored arent '0' (0 is stored as a char)

-readterfunc_exer2 :line 199: struct studentinfo type structure, requires int z var, similar to [struca1] it gets user input and
stores it in "struct student in" then returns "struct student in"

-printerfunc_exer2:line 242: struct studentinfo type function, asks for a structure (struct student info out) in the argument 
then prints given structure, it returns the given structure but it isnt used for anything 

-progend_func:line 262: int type function that is used when program ends, may change to void type as it returns nothing

-exer1_mainfunc :line 289: int type function, returns nothing, used as a central function for exer 1 of structures, 

-exer2_mainfunc :line 346: int type function, main function for exer 2 of structures, returns nothing :0

-exer3_mainfunc :line 478: int type funtions, main function for exer 3 of structures, returns, once again, nothing

-strcutexer_menu :line 530: int type function that serves as the menu for the structure exercises, returns nada

-readterfunc_exer3:line 402: struct atleta type function, stores user questions in "struct atleta a1". returns a1

-printer_exer3 :line 451: struct atleta type function, recieves a struct atleta z and integer x, prints values of the struct
, returns z but z isn't used

-main :line 580: main

-struct info2 input: line 122 : local structure used by struca1 to return it's info, later on is assigned to a structure
array of info2, explanation requires further work
